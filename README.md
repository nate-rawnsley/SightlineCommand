# Sightline Command

Requires Ultraleap Leap Motion Controller to play.

Requires 2 monitors (designed for one screen, one projector).
 
## HOW TO PLAY

A turn-based strategy game for two players. Players control either humans or aliens, with the goal of destroying each other's base.

Troops can move and attack a varying amount per turn, as well as create buildings (though buildings scale in cost, so place wisely!).

Selection mode can be changed in the UI - selecting a troop with a mode active (Move, Attack, Build) will perform the appropriate action.

From a suitable building (Base and Barracks), you can hire troops by spending your troop tokens. These will not replinish until the unit dies, though you can increase the cap by building barracks.

Once your turn is finished, click 'End Turn' and let your opponent begin their counter-attack.

## CONTROLS
